The company for this assignment needed sofvtware security solutions implemented into their system consisting of secure hash functions, static testing, certificate generation, and securing communications in the system.
Assessed the codebase to identify vulnerabilities, implemented the SHA-256 algorithm, and conducted dependency checks and manually addressed and suppressed vulnerabilities.
These steps promote data protection and authenticity and will help prevent an extreme recovery financial expense.
Using these tools helped me familiarize myself with using different automated tools and to regularly patch and update our software systems.
This detailed documentation demonstrates best practices in software development through testing and validation and using the proper automation tools, as well as utilizing appropriate algorithm ciphers and using secure communication protocols.
